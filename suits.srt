1
00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:03,575
- My son was imprisoned too.
- Says your son died

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:05,310
of a heart attack.
- There's something

3
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:07,245
they're not telling me.
- That kid?

4
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:08,580
He didn't just up and get
in a fight without good reason.

5
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:10,515
You don't know
what you talking about.

6
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:11,683
- Look, are the guards corrupt?
- No! He just died!

7
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,351
I need Mike to drop that case.

8
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:14,853
You telling me
to go back on my word

9
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:16,454
because your client's
bullying you?

10
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,323
It's one pro Bono.
He can drop it.

11
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,325
If I give you an assignment,
you do it.

12
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:23,128
Since I got here, I have had
to take shit from Louis.

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,629
And now you're asking me
to waste my time

14
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,132
and my ability
on something like this.

15
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,900
We can't have you
setting a precedent

16
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:31,503
that Alex's clients
can run roughshod all over us.

17
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,605
The only reason
that you're pissed about this

18
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:37,675
is your new honeysuckle friend
canceled lunch on you for me.

19
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:39,477
I can't let them get away
with this

20
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,246
without handing it off
to the one lawyer I know

21
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:42,714
who cares enough
to see this thing through.

22
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:45,450
If our firm is associated
with that case,

23
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:47,452
we lose a huge client.
- I'm not working on it.

24
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:48,887
Then you're gonna put that
in writing and you're gonna

25
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,488
deliver it to Alex's client.

26
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,223
I was just wondering.
Have you redone

27
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,525
the assignment
that Rachel gave you?

28
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:55,226
Not yet.

29
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:57,195
I had a ton on my plate.
- You're fired.

30
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:58,496
What kind of best man
would I be

31
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:00,198
if I didn't offer for you
to have it here?

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,499
Pretty shitty one,
if you ask me.

33
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,402
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Harvey.

34
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,178
You sure he's not in?

35
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,746
I hate to walk in
on the man

36
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:16,681
in his tighty-whities.

37
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,449
I don't think Harvey
wears tighty-whities.

38
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,251
Oh, Jesus Christ, Rachel.

39
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:23,321
I don't wanna think about
what the man wears.

40
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:25,957
Well...

41
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,725
what do you think?

42
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,460
This is great!

43
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,663
If you're a...
Bachelor pushing 50

44
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:34,199
and you need to impress
women.

45
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,368
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

46
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,937
Don't go in his fridge!
Rachel.

47
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,738
The man gave us his keys.
Trust me.

48
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,674
He knows we're gonna
go through his shit.

49
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,976
So basically you came here
to look at what he eats

50
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,245
and to say that this is
a "no" for the wedding.

51
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,414
Of course it's a no.
But the fact is...

52
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,449
why are we even talking
venue at all

53
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,984
when you don't even
have a date?

54
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,953
We're gonna get around
to that.

55
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:57,555
Mm-hmm.
Just like you...

56
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:00,291
got around
to the announcement?

57
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,327
- What?
- Your mother said

58
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,295
that she arranged
for a photographer,

59
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:06,764
but you cancelled.
Same with the florist.

60
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,300
What's going on?
- Nothing is going on.

61
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:11,636
Mike and I are both
really busy

62
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,805
getting our careers
off the ground right now.

63
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,473
Rachel, that's just it.

64
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,475
If you can't focus
on your wedding,

65
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:19,444
how are you gonna
make time to focus

66
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:22,013
on your marriage?

67
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:25,283
Now, that's why
you came here, isn't it?

68
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:27,452
To give me
sweet advice like that.

69
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:30,521
Well, that, and to tell
the mighty Harvey Specter

70
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:33,725
I took his toilet bowl
for a test drive.

71
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,362
Dad...you're not
doing that.

72
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:38,796
You know how to

73
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:41,366
suck the fun out of
everything, don'tcha?

74
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,334
Oh, my God.

75
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:53,745
You. Where the hell
is Stephanie?

76
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,413
- She's not here.
- What do you mean,

77
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:57,348
she's not here?
I just got off the phone

78
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
with a client, and she never
filed their motion to dismiss.

79
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:01,286
- That's because I fired her.
- You what?!

80
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,854
She was the smartest
fourth-year we had!

81
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:04,789
She was also insubordinate,
and I made a decision.

82
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,491
I don't give a shit
what you made.

83
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,426
She was working for me
on Delta Securities,

84
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,561
and I need her back.
- Okay, Louis,

85
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,030
I'm not getting her back.

86
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:13,665
What kind of message
does that send

87
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,500
to the other associates?
- Better than the one

88
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,402
we're sending out now
which is that this firm

89
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:19,037
is a Goddamn joke.
- Louis, you need to calm down

90
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,571
right now before this
goes in the wrong direction,

91
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,340
'cause this isn't about
Stephanie.

92
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:23,875
This is about Tara
and the fact that you

93
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,510
haven't been dealing with her.
- This has nothing to do

94
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:26,711
with Tara.
This is about Harvey

95
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:28,513
running this firm
into the ground.

96
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,048
And how exactly
has he been doing that?

97
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,683
Let me run it down for you.
I'm pissed at him.

98
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,451
Mike's pissed at him.
And the last time I saw you,

99
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,420
you were pissed at him.
So instead of telling me

100
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,854
that you're not gonna hire
Stephanie back,

101
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:39,457
why don't you go tell
the lord God almighty

102
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,059
that if he is not careful,

103
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,095
he's not gonna have
a kingdom to rule over anymore!

104
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,905
- Morning.
- Harvey, I'm sort of busy,

105
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:56,074
so if you're here
to shoot the shit--

106
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,076
I'm here
to give you this.

107
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:00,778
- What's this?
- It's my way of saying thanks.

108
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,681
- For what?
- You know what.

109
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,517
Harvey, I dropped the suit
because you asked me to.

110
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,353
You don't have to give me
anything in return.

111
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:10,788
Has anyone ever taught you
how to be gracious?

112
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,824
Open the file.

113
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:18,396
This's a pro Bono.

114
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:19,864
I figured you didn't
get to complete

115
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:22,400
your one-for-you this time,
so it's only fair.

116
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,901
Plus, you didn't want me
to sue you

117
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:25,870
for violating our agreement.
- Doesn't look good

118
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:28,673
to have Robin coming after
Batman for breach of contract.

119
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,875
Seriously, Mike, I know
how hard that was for you,

120
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:33,511
and I don't want there
to be any bad blood

121
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:34,779
between you and Alex.
- I don't have a problem

122
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,481
with Alex, Harvey.
- You sure?

123
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,750
I'm sure.

124
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:43,388
- Sure?
- Good. Yeah.

125
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,722
- All good?
- You should go.

126
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,164
Let me guess.

127
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,466
You're bored being C.O.O.,
you miss me,

128
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,768
and you want back
on my desk.

129
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,136
I never want back
on your desk, Harvey,

130
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,737
and I'm here to tell you

131
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:01,873
that your honeymoon
as Managing Partner is over.

132
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,608
Is this about me
not calling a vote

133
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,942
after you undermined me
in that meeting?

134
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,711
I'm gonna let that go

135
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,579
because you need to understand
that right now

136
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:09,914
people are mad at you.
- Relax, Donna.

137
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,849
I took care of Mike.
- Good for you.

138
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,818
You're one for three.
- Maybe you didn't know this,

139
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,621
but that's good enough to get
you into the Hall of Fame.

140
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,656
You know what, Harvey,
instead of being so arrogant,

141
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,825
maybe you could figure out
a way to keep all of us happy.

142
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:22,794
Starting with your number two.
- What's that supposed to mean?

143
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,862
It means Louis is out
of his mind at the moment.

144
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:27,732
You poured fuel on the fire,
and if you asked me

145
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,435
to choose between the two of you
for Managing Partner right now,

146
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:31,702
I'd choose Alex Williams.

147
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:32,970
- Donna--
- Listen to me, Harvey.

148
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:34,772
If making me C.O.O.

149
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,441
wasn't just some
bullshit move

150
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:37,842
to make me feel good,

151
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:39,577
you'll get your head
out of your ass,

152
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,912
listen to what
I'm telling you,

153
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:44,515
and realize
you've got a problem.

154
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,760
<i>♪ See the money,</i>
<i>wanna stay for your meal ♪</i>

155

165
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,562
Harvey.

166
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,397
Jessica.

167
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,532
Retirement suits you.

168
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,135
- I'm not retired.
- You look retired.

169
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:39,537
I look relaxed.
There's a difference.

170
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,406
Now, what's going on,
Harvey?

171
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:43,475
The last time you flew
to Chicago this often,

172
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,110
Michael was still playing.

173
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:48,013
I'm in a situation
at the office.

174
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:51,316
Well, the first thing
to do when you're in trouble

175
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,585
is admit to yourself what you
did to get yourself there.

176
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,320
What do you think I did?

177
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,422
I made a deal with Mike
to come back.

178
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,424
I made Donna a partner
without thinking it through.

179
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,626
I hired someone
against Louis's wishes.

180
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:04,129
And all those things
are colliding with each other

181
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,131
into a big pile of
"people hate Harvey."

182
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,066
Well, at least it's not
a big pile of

183
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,068
"people hate Jessica."
- That's your advice?

184
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,569
No.
No.

185
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:15,373
Harvey, my advice is to give
a big piece of new business

186
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,176
to the person least likely
to let anything go.

187
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,278
- Louis.
- Nine times outta ten.

188
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,148
I can't just manufacture
that overnight.

189
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,649
Harvey, do you remember
that time

190
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:28,319
we poached Trotter Systems
from Zane?

191
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,657
You gotta be shitting me.
That was a prearranged deal?

192
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,459
I worked my ass off
to get Trotter.

193
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:37,062
You did.
And you completely forgot

194
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,130
that you were pissed at me
about some bullshit

195
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,698
neither one of us
can remember anymore.

196
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,702
- Rook to bishop four.
- Exactly.

197
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:48,206
Now, take a look at your menu,
'cause I'm starving.

198
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,108
When, exactly,
do you think

199
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,177
I'm gonna stop coming
to you with these things?

200
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,411
The truth is, Harvey,

201
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:56,281
you don't need to come
to me anymore.

202
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,283
You just do it
'cause you miss me.

203
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:06,491
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a second?

204
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,326
Yeah. But I only have
a few minutes.

205
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:10,195
I have court.

206
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:12,530
I met with my dad at Harvey's
apartment this morning.

207
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:15,200
Don't tell me.
He said a bachelor pad

208
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:18,303
is no place for his
special little girl

209
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:20,138
to celebrate the biggest
day of her life.

210
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,506
Well, Mike,
you have to admit

211
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,174
the only reason
that we changed it

212
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,576
from the Plaza
in the first place

213
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,244
was because we didn't want
the attention.

214
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,646
But now that you're
a legitimate lawyer...

215
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,582
we don't have to worry
about that.

216
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,118
Rachel, it's okay.
I just want you to be happy.

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,652
- So you're not mad.
- Not at all.

218
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,689
Good. Because now that
it<i> is</i> at the Plaza,

219
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,158
I called and made an appointment
with the wedding team

220
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,193
for us to go over
some menu options.

221
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,195
Wait, wait, wait.
You made an appointment

222
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,764
in between when I said it
was okay a second ago and now?

223
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,533
Yeah, y-you didn't
just notice me do that?

224
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:51,269
It was<i> crazy</i> fast!
- You're fast.

225
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:55,273
Mike, seriously, I appreciate
you being so understanding.

226
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:57,542
The appointment
is tonight at 7:00.

227
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:59,777
Rachel, I have a meeting
tonight with my pro Bono,

228
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,413
and I can't put it off.
Can you do this one without me?

229
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,549
Of course I can, but
I wanted us to do it together.

230
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:05,683
Rachel, listen to me.

231
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,452
I know you...right?

232
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,220
You're gonna have
a thousand questions.

233
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:11,189
You're gonna want to
narrow down the choices.

234
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,725
I promise you I will be
at every other meeting.

235
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,793
Okay.
I'll take care of it.

236
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,163
- All right. Love you.
- Love you, too.

237
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,571
Why aren't you playing
from the men's tees?

238
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,573
If you're here to insist

239
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,408
that my daughter gets married
in that love shack of yours,

240
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,177
that ship has sailed.
- Oh, I don't care

241
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,611
if she gets married
at the Taj Mahal.

242
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,647
I'm here to take you up
on Jessica's arrangement.

243
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,215
Yeah. What arrangement
was that?

244
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,583
The one
where you do me a favor

245
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:39,717
and I give you
a big one in return.

246
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,452
What the hell do you think

247
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,720
letting Katrina Bennett
and Company

248
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,455
walk over to you
without a fight was?

249
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,257
I didn't ask you
to do that.

250
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,459
I don't care whether
you asked me or not.

251
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,662
It's been a thin quarter,
and I'm no Goddamn Santa Claus.

252
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,463
- Robert.
- Okay, Harvey.

253
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,731
You want a favor?
I'll give you one.

254
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,234
Instead of you asking me
for a handout,

255
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,702
you should watch your
backside,

256
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:00,471
because you've got a missile
coming straight for you.

257
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,507
- Bratton Gould.
- Yes. Bratton Gould.

258
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,342
What'd you think
they were gonna do

259
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,843
when you took their senior
partner and marquee client

260
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,413
out from under their noses?
- I knew they'd try

261
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,548
to retaliate, but I didn't think
it would happen this fast.

262
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,383
Well, today's the day.

263
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:14,419
Let me tell you something.

264
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,487
I have no love for them.

265
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,523
So I'll do whatever
I can to help.

266
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:21,693
But like I said,
it's been a thin quarter.

267
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,629
And I'm not letting you
get one of my clients.

268
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:31,736
Oliver.
What are you doing here?

269
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,504
- I need to talk to you.
- If it's about the case,

270
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:34,872
I can't do that,
and you know it.

271
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,708
- Please, I just need a minute.
- Oliver,

272
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,276
we signed an agreement.
I can't be doing this.

273
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,477
Not to mention
I have other cases.

274
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,845
The guard's testimony

275
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,680
doesn't match
their version of events,

276
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:44,616
and I can't prove it.
What do you mean?

277
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:46,818
The prison claims
the doctor was on the premises.

278
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,486
The guard says
they had to call him.

279
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,854
I asked for
surveillance video

280
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,456
to see if he was
already there.

281
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,690
They said they can't
disclose it

282
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,392
because it would violate
HIPAA rules.

283
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,660
Shit.
What about surveillance

284
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,495
of the parking lot?
- They're saying

285
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:58,863
that footage is gone.
- Then they're definitely

286
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,465
hiding something.
- But I can't prove it.

287
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,799
And if I don't get
something,

288
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,501
I can't move forward
with this case.

289
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,574
Listen, Oliver,
like I said,

290
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:10,808
I can't discuss this case.

291
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,744
What but what I can
tell you is that

292
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,479
if you can convince someone
that you already have something,

293
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,681
that's the best way
to get them in the room.

294
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,751
I get it--I convince them
I have the doctor's time card,

295
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,452
and he was nowhere near
that place,

296
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,488
I can get them to settle.
- Like I said,

297
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,424
I can't help you.

298
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,526
Good not talking
to you, Mike.

299
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,599
Harvey, we need to talk,
and it can't wait.

300
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,668
Then walk with me, because
Bratton's getting ready

301
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,436
to poach our clients,
and Louis needs to know.

302
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,771
He already knows.

303
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,572
They're making a play
for Delta Securities,

304
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:42,874
and that's not their only move.
- Don't tell me.

305
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,375
They're coming after
my clients too.

306
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:45,710
AC Technologies.

307
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,445
But, Harvey,
they're not trying to poach.

308
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:48,780
They're suing
for patent infringement.

309
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:50,682
Aw, shit!

310
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,651
Louis, whatever you're doing
to keep Delta Securities,

311
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:55,553
take a breath.
I need you to listen

312
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,555
to what I have to say.
- Oh, I'm done listening to you.

313
00:11:57,557 --> 00:11:59,524
You wanna manage this firm
into the ground,

314
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,492
you go right ahead.
But when your bullshit

315
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,528
puts one of my biggest
clients on the block,

316
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,463
that's when I'm done
playing good soldier.

317
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,332
Listen to me.
Bratton's not just coming

318
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,467
after our clients--they're
trying to divide and conquer.

319
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,469
What are you, Caesar now?
This isn't the Roman Empire.

320
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,705
I don't care what it is.
You think it's a coincidence

321
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,474
they're forcing you to close
on one of your clients

322
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,476
while suing one of mine
for patent infringement?

323
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,578
You're saying I can't
keep my own clients?

324
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,448
Louis, all he's saying
is you should switch clients

325
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,350
and play to your strengths.
- Pass!

326
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,951
Look, I get it--
you don't want Harvey's help

327
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,753
because you're mad at him.
But the least you can do

328
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,655
is to go Alex.
He came from Bratton.

329
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:32,490
He knows their playbook.
- I don't need their playbook.

330
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,359
And he's the reason
they're coming after us

331
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,594
in the first place.
- Okay, Louis, do it your way.

332
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:37,895
But you better be
good and ready,

333
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,664
because Bratton knew enough

334
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,532
to come after a client
you almost lost a year ago

335
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,900
and to sue mine
for something

336
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:44,769
I don't know anything about.

337
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,438
Which means they've got
someone inside this place

338
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,607
telling them what to do.

339
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:05,224
Louis, can I talk to you
for a second?

340
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,826
No, you can't, because
right at this moment--

341
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,161
I know, you're gonna
meet Delta Securities.

342
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,696
And Harvey already
made it clear

343
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,164
you don't want my help
trying to keep them.

344
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,132
But I have something--
- No buts, Alex.

345
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:14,801
I don't want your help.
I don't want whatever you have,

346
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,302
because I don't trust ya.
- Trust me? What the hell

347
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:17,704
are you talking about?
- For all I know,

348
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,372
you were the one who
gave Bratton

349
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,873
the inside information
on us in the first place.

350
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,408
You know what, Louis,
if you think that,

351
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,110
then why the hell don't you
fire me right now?

352
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:26,913
If it were up to me,
Alex, I would.

353
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,748
<i>Your Honor,</i>
<i>I don't care what they say.</i>

354
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,483
We filed our patent
before they did.

355
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:32,485
Well, beating
someone off the line

356
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,187
doesn't mean that you didn't
jump the gun to do it.

357
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,122
And our losses
are growing by the day.

358
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,758
Mr. Specter, you'll have your
chance to refute him at trial.

359
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,426
All right, listen,
you want me to be honest?

360
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,161
I haven't felt
prioritized lately.

361
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,763
Are you kidding me?

362
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:45,865
Who was there when you
had to restructure in '07?

363
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,501
Not to mention,
I just saved your ass last year.

364
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,269
And that was then.
And now I feel like

365
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,504
I can't even get you
on the phone anymore.

366
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:53,306
- Your Honor--
- That's enough.

367
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,874
I find the evidence
Mr. Walsh is presenting

368
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,743
compelling enough
to let this go forward.

369
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,277
There's only one problem
with that, Your Honor.

370
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,879
We just took one of
their partners,

371
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,280
all of his clients.
They're pissed about it,

372
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,915
and now they want
some get-back.

373
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,751
You being willing
to give me your phone number

374
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,252
isn't the point, Louis.
- Well, it should be.

375
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,287
- Who are you?
- This is Alex Williams,

376
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:11,491
our newest senior partner, and
he was just stopping by. Alex--

377
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:13,326
I'm not just the newest
senior partner, Tim.

378
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,895
I'm also the partner
that Bratton Gould just lost.

379
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,530
Your Honor,
they entered into

380
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,432
a fee-waiving partnership
agreement yesterday

381
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,200
with a company that's suddenly
claiming infringement

382
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:22,969
against
one of our clients today.

383
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:25,772
Your Honor, their client
caused real damages.

384
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,874
If that's true, those damages
will still be there

385
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,776
in eight weeks,
which means the only reason

386
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,878
you'd be upset right now
is if this action is nonsense.

387
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,947
So which is it--
eight weeks or drop the case?

388
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,317
Morelli's expense reports for
the last three years.

389
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,319
The guy spends
more time in Vegas

390
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:42,455
than David Blaine.
And now you know.

391
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:43,956
Just like you already know

392
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,792
that Louis kills
for you out there

393
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:48,795
whether he's taking
your calls or not.

394
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,198
I'll call you tomorrow
about the acquisition, Louis.

395
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,300
Thank you, Tim.

396
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:03,810
Nice move, finding out about
that partnership agreement.

397
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,344
Nice move telling
our client

398
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,346
he's not gonna be billed
for last quarter.

399
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:09,448
Nothing eases the pain
of a bullshit lawsuit

400
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,384
like cash in your pocket.
- Speaking of which,

401
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,486
I've been back at work
for three weeks now.

402
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:14,954
Thinking it's time
I got a raise.

403
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,589
Easy, tiger.

404
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:18,391
Mike, seriously,

405
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,960
I thought you were busy
with that pro Bono.

406
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,029
I am. Donna said
you needed my help,

407
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,430
so...I gave it to you.

408
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:25,598
Thanks, Robin.

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,835
Ah, you're welcome, Batman.

410
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,982
Louis, really...

411
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,551
you didn't have to do this.
- What, are you kidding?

412
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:47,386
You saved me
after I was an asshole.

413
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,588
You didn't have to do that.
- Yes, I did.

414
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,523
Because I don't care
how you acted.

415
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,525
We're all
in the same boat now.

416
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,528
I guess we are.

417
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,865
Boy, you really...have no
love for your old firm, do you?

418
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,633
If I'm being truthful
with you,

419
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,902
I was never gonna get
where I wanted to be

420
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,503
as long as I was there.

421
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,340
- Name partner.
- Name partner.

422
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,879
You know, I thought of
leaving Pearson Hardman

423
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,080
at one point.
- Bullshit.

424
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,882
No, it's the truth.

425
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:17,416
I even got a headhunter
and everything.

426
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,452
- I thought you loved it there.
- I do.

427
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,287
Doesn't mean
that I didn't feel

428
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,122
unappreciated and overlooked.

429
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:25,291
I find it hard to believe
anyone could overlook you.

430
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:27,126
Well, they did,
and I got to thinking...

431
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:31,130
I can be the best
lawyer in the world, and...

432
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,332
it won't change
how they see me.

433
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,034
Like you must have been
out sick or something

434
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,669
the day the name partner gods
came down

435
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,437
saying who's gonna make it
up the God damn mountain.

436
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,139
That's exactly right,
and it turns out

437
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:41,674
I wasn't sick that day,
and neither were you.

438
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,576
And if you ever
feel overlooked again,

439
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,344
I would hope that
you can come to me

440
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,545
so I can help fix it.

441
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,047
Means a lot to me, Louis.

442
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,016
Well...

443
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,584
like you said...

444
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,486
We're all in the same
boat now.

445
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,933
Rachel, do you have
a minute?

446
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,434
I need your help.
- Yeah, of course.

447
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,970
What's going on?
- I think Stephanie Patel

448
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,539
may be helping Bratton
poach our clients.

449
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,075
What? Since when
is Stephanie at Bratton?

450
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,077
Since this morning,
and it's a long story,

451
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,446
but someone gave them
inside information about us,

452
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,448
and given
that she just started...

453
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,083
I need you to go over
there,

454
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,618
and I need you
to get her to stop.

455
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,520
Me? How am I supposed
to do that?

456
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,355
I don't care if it means
offering her her job back.

457
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:30,957
But whatever it is,
it has to happen tonight.

458
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,025
Wait, Donna, you can't
be serious right now.

459
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:35,094
- It's the only way that we--
- Donna, Louis eviscerated her,

460
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,963
and you fired her.
There's no way

461
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:38,698
she's ever coming back here.
You don't know that.

462
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Not to mention the fact that
I have a meeting this evening

463
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:42,501
with the wedding planner, so--
I don't care

464
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:43,970
what you have tonight.
We need to do something,

465
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:47,039
and we need to do it now.

466
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,141
Okay.
What's going on?

467
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:51,177
Harvey took a chance
on me, Rachel.

468
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,012
He went out on a limb,

469
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,981
and now I have been
promoted to a position

470
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,482
that people think
I'm not ready for.

471
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,984
I didn't mean it
when I said that.

472
00:17:57,986 --> 00:17:59,652
I know that.
But if one of the

473
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,620
first things I did ends up
giving Bratton

474
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,589
a roadmap to picking
this firm apart,

475
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:05,391
I will never forgive
myself.

476
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,126
And Stephanie might not
talk to you,

477
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:11,030
but I know
she won't talk to me.

478
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,999
Okay.

479
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,533
I'll go see her, Donna.

480
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,748
Anything else you
want me to fix for you

481
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,617
before I get back to my case?
- I'll let you know

482
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,319
after I see Louis.
- What do you mean?

483
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,853
I mean if he couldn't
stop Bratton

484
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:34,256
from poaching his client,
us doing what we just did

485
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:36,291
only gives us a split decision.
- But you said Louis

486
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,492
made it clear
he doesn't want your help.

487
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:38,727
He may not want it,

488
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,429
but if that shit's
not taken care of,

489
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,497
he's getting it whether
he likes it or not.

490
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,638
Louis, before you jump
down my throat again--

491
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,407
Relax, Harvey, I'm not
upset with you anymore.

492
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,310
In fact, I even came to
an agreement with Alex

493
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:57,579
after he locked up
Delta Securities.

494
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,849
- Good.
- What about you?

495
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:03,285
Do you need my help
with your lawsuit?

496
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,654
It's taken care of.
Don't tell him I said this,

497
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,623
but Mike jumped inside
his phone booth

498
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,524
and put on his Superman
outfit.

499
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,493
Oh, that's great.
So I guess...

500
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,895
this means there's only one
thing left for you to do.

501
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:18,634
Well, I'd say there's only
one thing left for us to do.

502
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,269
You want me to go
with you?

503
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,904
Your name's up on that
wall, isn't it?

504
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,316
I see you got
your own office.

505
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,518
What are you doing here?

506
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,354
I know that you didn't
feel valued at Pearson Specter,

507
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:42,391
and I wanted to apologize
for my part in that.

508
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:44,359
I also just--I wanted you
to know

509
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,495
that it was never my intention
to get you fired.

510
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,764
I hope you're not here
to offer me my job back.

511
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:52,801
- And what if I said I was?
- I'd say I wouldn't take it.

512
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,636
Okay...
in that case,

513
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,672
I am here to find out

514
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,308
if you're giving your new firm
privileged information.

515
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,609
Let me get this straight.

516
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,878
You have...the nerve
to fire me

517
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,780
and then come here
and accuse me

518
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,848
of breaking
attorney-client privilege?

519
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,451
How else is your firm
getting so much information

520
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:11,820
on our on-going cases?
- You think I'm the only person

521
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,555
with a grudge
against your firm?

522
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,791
Harvey Specter
declared war on this place

523
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,693
long before I got here.

524
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,895
And not only am I not
giving them information,

525
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,731
they don't need my help,
and they didn't ask for my help.

526
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,733
Just to be clear, Stephanie,
you've lied to me before.

527
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,535
And breaking attorney-client
privilege

528
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:27,869
is a dis-barrable offense,

529
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,471
and if we find out
that's what's been

530
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:30,472
happening here--
- No, Rachel,

531
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:31,640
I didn't lie to you.

532
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:33,542
Like you said,
I used a loophole.

533
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:35,844
'Cause I'm a good lawyer,
and I'm also an ethical lawyer.

534
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,713
So if this firm is getting
inside information

535
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:38,914
from Pearson Specter,

536
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,782
they're not getting it
from me.

537
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:47,956
Hey, Mike, wait up.

538
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,758
Oliver, what are you
doing here?

539
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,526
I was just waiting for you
so we can grab that beer

540
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:52,961
like we talked about.
- Except we didn't

541
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:55,697
talk about grabbing--
- Just walk with me.

542
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,500
God damn it, Oliver,

543
00:20:58,502 --> 00:20:59,901
I told you--
- Mike, relax.

544
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:02,537
It's over.
The bluff worked.

545
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,573
What do you mean,
it worked?

546
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:07,542
I got a number,
and it's good.

547
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,647
Shit.

548
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:13,982
What?

549
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:16,651
This offer's not just good.
It's too good.

550
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,520
What're you talking about?

551
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:19,888
You think they're not gonna pay?
- I mean this isn't

552
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,723
the number you give
to make someone go away.

553
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,725
It's a number you give when
you need them to go away.

554
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,527
You're saying you think
there's more cases

555
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:26,895
like this out there.
- I'm saying that when

556
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,563
someone acts like this,
there's more to find.

557
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:29,798
Which means you need
to convince Mr. Reyes

558
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,501
to turn this down
and keep looking.

559
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,669
Are you serious, Mike?
This is more money

560
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,705
than this family's ever seen.
- And you convince them--

561
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,740
What? That I'm gonna
find all those other cases?

562
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,809
I already bluffed 'em
once, Mike.

563
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:43,011
And the only reason we were
able to make this case

564
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,780
is because we threatened
to sue them

565
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,748
over a specific guy.
- Then knock on the door

566
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,617
of everyone that has come
out of that place

567
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,019
and find more guys.
- Mike...

568
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:55,524
If there are other
victims out there,

569
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,958
I feel for them.

570
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,429
But I'm representing Oscar.
He's suffering.

571
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,697
And I don't feel right
telling him not to do this.

572
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,499
So if you want this done,

573
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:06,768
you're gonna have to
do it yourself.

574
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:19,080
Rachel, please tell me
that you got her to back off.

575
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,882
<i>- It wasn't her.</i>
- What do you mean,

576
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:22,784
it wasn't her?
It had to be her.

577
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:24,586
Donna, I apologized to her.

578
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,621
I threatened her,
and I cajoled her.

579
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:28,657
Trust me--it wasn't her.

580
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,494
Rachel...look,
I didn't mean that stuff

581
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:35,063
that I said before about not
caring about your appointment.

582
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,998
- I know.
<i>- Well, did you make it?</i>

583
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,834
<i>'Cause I'd hate to think</i>
<i>you missed it for nothing.</i>

584
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:40,869
I'm walking in right now.
Don't worry.

585
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,004
I'm right on time.

586
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,640
Hi. I'm so sorry.

587
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:46,908
Rachel Zane.

588
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,610
Deborah Kaplan.

589
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:50,812
Did my assistant
give you the wrong time?

590
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,113
Because I had us down
for 7:00.

591
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,915
And it's almost 8:00.
I know.

592
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,485
I had an emergency at work,
and it couldn't wait.

593
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:59,654
But my understanding was
it's a two-hour appointment.

594
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,056
So I was just hoping
that we could

595
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,758
go over as much as possible.
- Of course.

596
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,627
The truth is, I usually
take the first hour

597
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:06,928
to offer you a glass
of champagne

598
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,864
and try to get to
know you anyway.

599
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:10,532
But the champagne
is still cold,

600
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,934
and we can just
dive right in.

601
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,138
You still double-billing

602
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,940
to pay for that house
in the Hamptons?

603
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:21,142
No. I'm working late
to pay for it.

604
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:23,011
And the one in Vail
and the apartment in Paris.

605
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,679
That's a lotta homes.

606
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,681
Sounds like a man
who's compensating.

607
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:30,652
So how're you doing, Harvey?
- Oh, he's doing great.

608
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:33,088
'Cause we just shut down your
pathetic assault on our firm.

609
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,890
- Is that so?
- You're Goddamn right,

610
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:36,658
that's so.
Then might I ask what exactly

611
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,926
are you doing here?
We're here to tell you

612
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,661
that if you try this shit
again,

613
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,062
the same thing's gonna happen,

614
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,964
only next time,
we won't just play defense.

615
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,699
We'll hit you with
a tortious interference suit

616
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,735
in the neighborhood
of a billion dollars.

617
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,871
Well, you better get ready,

618
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:52,040
'cause next time...
starts right now.

619
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:53,808
What, are you kidding?

620
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,143
You already threw
everything you had at us once.

621
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:57,112
Didn't make a dent.
- Not everything.

622
00:23:57,114 --> 00:24:00,048
By tomorrow morning, I'll be
poaching 20 of your clients,

623
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,950
and I'll be suing
another 20 of his.

624
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:03,852
And that little trick
you played

625
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:05,987
in the courtroom today?
It isn't going to

626
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:07,889
work tomorrow.
- Tom, you made your point.

627
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:09,925
You're pissed off
that we brought Alex over,

628
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,927
but this doesn't have to--
- I don't give two shits

629
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:13,094
about Alex Williams.

630
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:15,797
Lawyers grow on Goddamn trees.

631
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,832
I want my clients back,

632
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,001
and I want the 30 million
in billables

633
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,770
that come along with them,

634
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:23,805
hand-delivered...by you.

635
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,775
- That's never gonna happen.
- What do you think, Harvey?

636
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,110
Do you think that's
"never gonna happen"?

637
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:31,112
Like I said,
whatever you throw at us,

638
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,847
we'll throw it
right the hell back.

639
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,115
With what manpower?

640
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:35,750
You wanna pick a fight

641
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,152
with a little
regional law firm

642
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,987
to flex your muscles,
go ahead.

643
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,856
But we're five times
your size.

644
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:44,993
This is a fight<i> you</i> started.

645
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,829
And this is a fight
that you cannot win.

646
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,131
So you give me back
my clients,

647
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:52,767
or your legacy
at Pearson Specter Litt

648
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:54,669
is going to be
that you were the one

649
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,805
that put them in the ground.

650
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:04,681
Let me get this straight.

651
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,617
I got an offer for more money

652
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:08,151
than I'll see my whole life,

653
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:09,786
and you want me
to turn it down

654
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,822
based on a feeling that
whatever happened to Chris

655
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,357
happened to other people?
- It's not a feeling.

656
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,158
It's an instinct
that comes from

657
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,760
working on hundreds
of cases like this.

658
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:18,695
And if you take this deal,

659
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,764
you're never gonna get
the answers you want.

660
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:24,167
You'll never know
what happened to your son.

661
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,169
And I have another son

662
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:27,638
and two daughters,

663
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,806
and this changes
their lives.

664
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,908
- Mr. Reyes--
- Are you telling me

665
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,244
that you can prove
they had something to do

666
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,646
with my son's death?

667
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:37,681
Yes. I believe

668
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,083
that Oliver can get enough to--
- No, not Oliver.

669
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,886
You. Because you're the one
who took my case,

670
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,821
and then you backed out.
- I told you,

671
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,691
there was a conflict.
- I don't know what that means.

672
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,660
Then listen to me
right now.

673
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:51,795
I know that you know my parents
died in a car accident.

674
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:54,297
But what you don't know
is that after they did,

675
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,733
a lawyer...came to my
grandmother

676
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,702
and made her an offer.

677
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,837
She took it,
instead of going to court.

678
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,406
And I am telling you,

679
00:26:02,408 --> 00:26:05,208
she regretted that
for the rest of her life.

680
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,380
Oscar, there's no price
that'll make the pain go away.

681
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,152
Then what will?

682
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,753
Doing everything you can

683
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:19,389
to make sure no one else
ever has to feel it too.

684
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:25,262
At least, that's the closest
I've ever gotten.

685
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,864
And you think
turning this down will do that.

686
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,233
I think Chris is gone and
we can't ever bring him back.

687
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:31,468
Which means this is about

688
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,403
more than just money
or justice.

689
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,773
It's about stopping other
people like him from dying.

690
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:40,277
And I think it can be done,
but...

691
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,446
even if it can't...

692
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:43,914
we gotta try.

693
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,890
Tell them no.

694
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,838
- Harvey, how'd it go?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

695
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,773
<i>I didn't think it mattered</i>
<i>before,</i>

696
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,508
but they've got someone
feeding them inside information.

697
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,210
I need to know who it is.

698
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:15,312
I'm already working
on it, Harvey.

699
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,013
<i>Good. 'Cause this is your</i>
<i>chance to prove to everybody</i>

700
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:20,851
I made the right decision
giving you that promotion.

701
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,819
Robert.

702
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,888
We need to talk.
- From what I hear,

703
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,757
you need to spend
less time talking

704
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,458
and more time looking over
your firm.

705
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,796
And you said if I needed
help doing that to let you know.

706
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:33,797
All right.
Let's have it.

707
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,432
What do you need?

708
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:38,235
It's nothing you haven't
proposed to Jessica before.

709
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:40,270
You gotta be kidding me.
You want to merge?

710
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:41,471
I'm not talking about
a real merger.

711
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,507
I'm talking about
putting out word

712
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:45,342
that two of the best firms
in the city

713
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,512
are now one of the biggest
firms in the city.

714
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:50,547
You don't have the manpower
to fight him, do you?

715
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,516
Bratton's making this
an arms race, Robert.

716
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,518
If I don't have the numbers
to fight a war,

717
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,419
I have to at least
make it look like I do.

718
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,256
- I can't do it, Harvey.
- Robert, it's a bluff.

719
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:01,224
A bluff with nothing
but downside for me.

720
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:02,492
That's not true.
When this is over,

721
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,361
you can have your pick
of the clients

722
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:05,962
that came over from Bratton.
- When this is over,

723
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,964
I'm gonna look like
I backed away from a merger,

724
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,933
that I can't be trusted,
not to mention

725
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,902
that I look like I'm so weak

726
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,237
that I needed to merge with
a struggling firm like yours

727
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,539
to begin with.
- Is that what you think

728
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:18,842
we are--struggling?
- Harvey...

729
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:21,077
you need me to answer
that...

730
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,848
then you've got an even bigger
problem than Tommy Bratton.

731
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,395
Harvey, please tell me Zane
went for the merger idea.

732
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:39,963
- He didn't.
- Damn it! We're gonna drown

733
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:41,531
without any help.
- Then we'll get help.

734
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,333
What do you think
we've been working on?

735
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,068
I thought you were trying
to find the leak.

736
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,536
- We were, but we can't.
- And since Zane might say no,

737
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:48,905
I put out some feelers
with headhunters

738
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,874
to see about getting some
first-years and paralegals.

739
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:52,509
The problem is, we need
a minimum of 2 dozen each

740
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,411
to handle the workload,
but it's gonna run us

741
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,012
over 3 million a year.
- Then we'll get a bridge loan

742
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,014
from your guy at Fidelity.
- We already used

743
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:01,084
that line of credit last year
when we expanded the 42nd floor.

744
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:02,319
- Shit.
- Harvey, what the hell

745
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,054
are we gonna do?

746
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,923
I don't see a way out of this.
- I have a way out.

747
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,491
Give them what they want.

748
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:09,960
I'm not giving up
your clients, Alex.

749
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:11,528
I do that, I might as well
let you go.

750
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,330
Then let me go,
because I'm not gonna

751
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:15,031
be responsible
for driving you in the ground.

752
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,567
- No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why the hell not?

753
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,002
Because you're one of us now.

754
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:20,570
And I agree.

755
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:22,572
Well, what are we
gonna do?

756
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:24,341
You're gonna go back
to finding out

757
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:26,443
who's feeding them
inside information,

758
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:27,911
and you two
are gonna figure out

759
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,579
who they're coming after
first.

760
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,916
And I'm gonna figure out how to
beat this son of a bitch.

761
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,158
Mike, hey.
How'd it go?

762
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,394
- He turned the offer down.
- Thank God.

763
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:46,363
I thought you'd be
disappointed.

764
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:48,131
That was before
I found this...

765
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:51,434
and this...

766
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:53,470
and this.

767
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:55,939
- Holy shit.
- You were right.

768
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,674
As soon as I started
looking in the right places,

769
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,609
all the apples started
falling from the tree.

770
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,378
There's gotta be
at least 20 complaints

771
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,647
of prisoners being denied
their release date.

772
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,181
And every one of them
involves injuries

773
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,117
and some kind of vague
disciplinary action.

774
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,085
Jesus. They're not just
cheaping out on medical care.

775
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:11,488
They're manufacturing revenue.

776
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,090
Oliver, this...

777
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,992
This is unbelievable.
You got a class now.

778
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,560
There's only one problem.

779
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:20,196
I don't have the resources
to handle this alone.

780
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,098
Oliver, we've been
over this.

781
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
I signed an agreement
that said I wouldn't touch it.

782
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:26,369
I can't cross that line.
- Jesus Christ, Mike.

783
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:28,104
You're telling me you care
more about some

784
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:29,606
piece of paper you signed
than about these men's lives?

785
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,474
No, I don't,
but I signed it.

786
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,376
Which means if I get involved
and they find out,

787
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,445
the case gets tossed,
and Oscar gets nothing.

788
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:37,380
You lived a lie for years.
You're telling me

789
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:40,050
you can't keep a secret
about working one Goddamn case?

790
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:41,618
- I gave Harvey my word.
- So what the hell

791
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,687
am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to

792
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,089
convince Nathan to give you
the resources to pursue this.

793
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:47,958
And when I can't and I have to
go back and tell Oscar

794
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,993
that we can't
move forward with this...

795
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,194
that's gonna be on you.

796
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:00,236
I know how to
take down Bratton.

797
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,972
Alex,
we've been over this.

798
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:03,707
I am not giving up you
or your clients.

799
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:06,476
I'm not talking about that.
I got something on him.

800
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,178
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

801
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,013
You know why.

802
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:11,648
Because whatever it is,

803
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,750
he's got the same
damn thing on you.

804
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,019
Son of a bitch.

805
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:17,554
You should have told me
this before.

806
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,122
I couldn't.
You never would've hired me.

807
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,690
I meant when they started
coming after us.

808
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,058
I was hoping I wouldn't
have to use it.

809
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,660
Well, now I do.
What is it?

810
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,662
- I can't tell you.
- Are you kidding me?

811
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:27,697
As long as I don't tell you,
you're not party to it.

812
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,265
I'm not gonna expose you
like that.

813
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,067
I'm gonna take care
of this myself.

814
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:32,469
If you're gonna do that,

815
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:34,204
then why are you even
coming to me?

816
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,172
Because you took me in.
I'm a part of this firm now,

817
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,041
and if I do this, I'm not
sure what's gonna come of it.

818
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,210
That's not good enough.
You go over there and do this,

819
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,212
you sure as hell
better make it work.

820
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,458
All right, good.
We'll wrap this up tomorrow.

821
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,793
Thanks.

822
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,335
I was wondering when
you'd come crawling back.

823
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:04,636
I'm back,
but I'm not crawling.

824
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:06,238
I'm here to tell you

825
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,739
you're backing the hell off
my firm.

826
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:10,542
I know what you're here to do,
but let me ask you this.

827
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:13,345
Does your firm know what it is
that you did?

828
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,779
No. But if you don't
let this shit go,

829
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:17,616
they're not gonna be
the only ones I tell.

830
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:20,552
And not just what I did.
What you did.

831
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,522
I let this shit go,

832
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:27,325
and it comes back
and hits you in the ass.

833
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:30,729
You're gonna sign something

834
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,832
saying I had
nothing to do with this.

835
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,767
I already did.

836
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,738
Just like I also prepared
something for you to sign

837
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,340
saying you won't so much
as look at any of our clients

838
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,476
for the next ten years.

839
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:52,050
- You're willing to do this.
- Like I said.

840
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:54,386
I already did it.

841
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,327
It's on you now.

842
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,463
Yes. It is.

843
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:16,074
Is it done?

844
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:17,542
What do you think?

845
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:19,411
I think you probably
went in there

846
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,713
and said something like, "You're
gonna drop these lawsuits

847
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,515
"and you're gonna forget
about coming after

848
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,350
any of our clients."

849
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:27,919
And he said, "Our clients?
Don't you mean my clients?"

850
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:31,890
And I said, "No,
motherfu--er, I don't.

851
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:33,925
"Because I'm at
Pearson Specter now,

852
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:37,362
and he's not getting
my clients."

853
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:40,598
You're twice the man
he is, Alex.

854
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,567
- What do you mean?
- I mean if the ship

855
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,703
were sinking, Tommy Bratton
would throw his best friend

856
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:47,405
overboard
to get himself to shore.

857
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,774
You, on the other hand,
would offer him a life raft.

858
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,710
Thanks, Harvey.

859
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:54,979
No, Alex.
Thank you.

860
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:01,820
Hey...

861
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,722
what are we gonna tell
Louis and Donna

862
00:34:03,724 --> 00:34:05,490
about how this all went away?

863
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:07,425
We're gonna tell them
we did whatever it took.

864
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:10,462
And for the record,
Louis is right.

865
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:12,530
You are one of us now.

866
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,970
Don't tell Louis
I said he was right.

867
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:20,972
Don't worry about it.
I only listen to

868
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:23,742
every third thing you say
anyway.

869
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:29,948
Hey.

870
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,751
- Hey.
- I just realized I never

871
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,553
asked how the meeting
at the Plaza went.

872
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:37,522
Um...

873
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:39,924
I canceled it.

874
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:42,627
- I don't understand.
- I got there late,

875
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:44,796
and the woman started
showing me options anyway.

876
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:46,531
But I realized...

877
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,533
I was spending more time
thinking about

878
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:50,969
who was feeding Bratton Gould
inside information

879
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:53,004
than I was about

880
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,507
what color our napkins
were going to be.

881
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:58,443
So you don't wanna have it
at the Plaza anymore?

882
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:01,179
No, that's not it.
Mike, what's wrong with us?

883
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,681
We can't even find the time
to keep one appointment.

884
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,850
Rachel, come on, our schedules
are crazy right now.

885
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:08,620
And that's exactly what I told
my dad when he brought it up.

886
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:10,555
Brought what up?

887
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,558
He said that if we can't make
time for each other right now,

888
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,027
how are we gonna
make time for our marriage?

889
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,529
Hey.

890
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:25,603
You are the most
important thing in my life.

891
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,605
If you wanna
drop everything right now

892
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:30,008
and plan the wedding
and the honeymoon

893
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,876
and start picking out
baby names,

894
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:33,511
then that's what
we'll do.

895
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:34,946
That's the thing.

896
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,948
I don't wanna drop
everything right now.

897
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,950
I wanna get married...

898
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:42,520
but I also really care
about what I do.

899
00:35:42,522 --> 00:35:44,456
Maybe your father's right.

900
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,957
- Mike--
- No, I mean that he's right

901
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,959
about how hard it is for us
to throw ourselves

902
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:50,728
into our wedding right now,
but...

903
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,730
he's wrong if he thinks
we never will.

904
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:54,699
- What does that mean?
- That means

905
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,568
that I care about
what I do too.

906
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,670
And right now I gotta
go take care of something

907
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:01,039
that I should have
taken care of before, but...

908
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,041
when we get home,

909
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:04,676
we're gonna crack open
a bottle of wine,

910
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:06,511
and we're gonna talk
all night

911
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:08,913
about the kind of wedding
we wanna have.

912
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:11,082
And then we are gonna
pick a date.

913
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,618
Really?

914
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,019
Really.

915
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,036
Harvey, I know you're
coming in here to--

916
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:33,872
Donna, relax.
I came over here to tell you

917
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:35,640
that it's over.

918
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,642
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

919
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:41,613
I know you've been working
around the clock on this thing.

920
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,615
I'm sorry, Harvey.

921
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:46,017
- What do you mean?
- You promoted me.

922
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:47,919
You had faith in me,

923
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:49,921
and I never found out
who it was--I let you down.

924
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,756
Donna, you haven't
let me down in 12 years,

925
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:54,025
and you didn't start now.

926
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:57,295
Besides, whoever it was...

927
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:59,030
doesn't matter anymore.

928
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:19,918
Hello?

929
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,619
<i>It was you, wasn't it?</i>

930
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,787
What was me?

931
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:24,122
Don't bullshit me, Jessica.

932
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:25,790
You called Tommy Bratton

933
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,158
and gave him the roadmap
to me and Louis,

934
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,793
and I wanna know why.

935
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:30,662
<i>If you figured</i> that<i> out,</i>

936
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,797
<i>then you already know why.</i>
- I want an answer.

937
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:35,633
You came to me saying
that your house was divided.

938
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:37,669
And whether you like
hearing it or not, Harvey,

939
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:41,573
<i>nothing unites a divided house</i>
<i>like an attack from the outside.</i>

940
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,107
That doesn't mean you pick up
the phone and call him.

941
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,810
I didn't call him.
He called me.

942
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,845
He was coming anyway, Harvey.

943
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:49,948
All I did was mention that...

944
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,015
I didn't like the way
I was treated

945
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:52,684
on my way out the door,

946
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,986
<i>and if he wanted</i>
<i>to get to you,</i>

947
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:56,688
<i>he should play you</i>
<i>against Louis.</i>

948
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,056
Jessica, I called you
for advice,

949
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:59,924
not so that you'd
go behind the scenes

950
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,726
and manipulate things.
<i>- Harvey.</i>

951
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,027
- You said I was ready.
-<i> You are.</i>

952
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:04,796
<i>And now they know you are,</i>

953
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:08,099
and they're behind you
for the next time.

954
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:13,972
- I guess I should thank you.
<i>- You're welcome, Harvey.</i>

955
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:16,608
But you pull something
like this again...

956
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,977
I won't have to.

957
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,680
Good night, Jessica.

958
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:24,215
Good night, Harvey.

959
00:38:37,764 --> 00:38:40,732
- Well, look who it is.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

960
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:44,135
<i>Just getting ready</i>
<i>for trial tomorrow.</i>

961
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,404
It never stops, does it?

962
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:49,140
<i>- What's that?</i>
- The work of being a lawyer.

963
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:52,744
Doesn't mean you
can't make time for...

964
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:55,013
The more important things.
<i>- Speaking of the more</i>

965
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:57,181
important things--I set
a meeting with the planner

966
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:59,050
at the Plaza.

967
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,152
It's gonna be wonderful.

968
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:02,887
Thank you.

969
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:05,023
Aw, you don't have to
thank me, Rachel.

970
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:07,959
All I want is for your wedding
to be exactly what you want.

971
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,894
<i>And what I want</i>
<i>is gonna take some time,</i>

972
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:10,928
<i>because, Dad, you were right.</i>

973
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,065
I want to...enjoy it

974
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:16,868
and make time for it.

975
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,170
So Mike and I
are gonna set a date,

976
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,773
but it's not gonna be
for a while.

977
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,908
Well, it doesn't matter
when it is.

978
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,977
As long as you're happy.

979
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:29,847
<i>Good. Because there's</i>
<i>something else I wanted to say.</i>

980
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:33,151
I heard this idea
of a fake merger

981
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:35,920
between us was floated.
<i>- Let me guess.</i>

982
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:39,090
You think I should have
helped Harvey out.

983
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:41,793
<i>No. What I was gonna say</i>
<i>was even though it was fake,</i>

984
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:45,296
I got kind of excited about the
thought of working with my dad.

985
00:39:50,203 --> 00:39:52,737
I never thought
I'd ever hear you say that.

986
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:55,039
<i>Well, Katrina told me</i>
<i>that you said something once</i>

987
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,475
that I was afraid
I'd never hear, and...

988
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:01,212
It meant everything to me.

989
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:02,980
And what's that?

990
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:05,216
That you think
I'm a great lawyer.

991
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:07,819
And that you're proud of me.

992
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,256
Rachel...

993
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:16,227
I may not say it often enough.

994
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:19,063
But I think it all the time.

995
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:24,102
I love you, Dad.

996
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:27,939
I love you too, baby.

997
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:43,821
- Hello.
<i>- Oliver, it's me.</i>

998
00:40:43,823 --> 00:40:45,957
<i>Sorry, Mike,</i>
<i>I can't talk right now.</i>

999
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:48,526
I'm kinda busy being overwhelmed
by a case I can't handle.

1000
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,795
I take it you couldn't
convince Nathan

1001
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:53,164
to get you more people?
<i>- No. I couldn't.</i>

1002
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,968
Well, in that case...

1003
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,936
I'm in.

1004
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,105
What about your promise
to Harvey?

1005
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,876
You let me worry
about Harvey.
